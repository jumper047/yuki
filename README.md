# Yuki

Yuki is yet another voice assistant. The only difference from similar projects is the integration with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) and extended support of the russian language.

## Getting Started

The project is on whery early stage, and installation process for now is tricky and undocumented.

### Prerequisites

[Appdaemon 1.X](http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

[Snowboy](http://docs.kitt.ai/snowboy/)

[Mycroft.AI's adapt library](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/adapt/)

And some other libs which you can find in source code and install via pip. Sorry for thar.

### Installation

Yuki has written as an app for AppDaemon. For installation, it is enough to clone the repository in the AppDaemon application folder, and add the contents of appdaemon.cfg to the end of the configuration file
